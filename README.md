# zenith-sim-scheduler-lab

`zenith-sim-scheduler-lab` is a focused C# codebase around create a C# reference implementation for scheduler workflows, centered on constraint solving, bounded scenario files, and conflict explanations. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Zenith Sim Scheduler Lab Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the simulations idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## Reason For The Project

The goal is to capture the core behavior in code and make the surrounding assumptions obvious. A reader should be able to run the verifier, open the fixtures, and understand why each decision was made.

## Capabilities

- Models input state with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep policy checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for fixture data, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents local reports tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## How It Is Put Together

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The C# code keeps the core model in a small static API and runs checks through the executable path.

## Where Things Live

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Getting It Running

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Data Notes

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Tradeoffs

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Possible Extensions

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more simulations fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
